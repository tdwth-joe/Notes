I often find myself without my journal these days, and i pretty much loath modern flashy note taking interfaces with their modern designs and modern layouts ðŸ¤®. All joking aside. I simply wanted a nice minimalst app that all it does is take plain text format notes. and quick to pop open and just take notes wherever Iâ€™m at.

mini jot (jotty, jots, jotter, name pending, etc) is a shorthand note system that is meant for jotting down things throughout your day, inspired by bullet journal and atomic habits. Itâ€™s simple monotone minimalist interface is easily approachable for anyone to use.
